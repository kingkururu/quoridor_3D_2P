## 🎯 Features

- **Real-time Networking**: Berkeley sockets implementation for seamless multiplayer experience
- **2.5D Graphics**: 3D-like board visualization with SFML-powered rendering using raycasting
- **Interactive UI**: Intuitive controls for piece movement and wall placement

## 🎮 Game Rules

Quoridor is a strategic race game where:
- **Objective**: Be the first player to reach the opposite side of the 9x9 board
- **Movement**: Move your pawn one square per turn (orthogonally)
- **Wall Placement**: Alternatively, place a wall to block your opponent's path
- **Wall Restrictions**: Each player has 10 walls; walls cannot completely block a path to the goal
- **Victory Condition**: First player to reach any square on the opposite side wins

## 🎮 Controls

- **Click**: Place walls (horizontal/vertical)
- **W**: Move forward
- **S**: Move backward  
- **A**: Rotate camera left / turn player left
- **D**: Rotate camera right / turn player right


## 🌐 Networking Features

The game implements **Berkeley sockets** (BSD sockets/POSIX sockets) for multiplayer functionality:

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Native socket API support on Unix-like systems
- **Real-time Communication**: Low-latency game state synchronization
- **Connection Management**: Automatic handling of client-server connections
- **Game State Sync**: Seamless board updates across networked players
- **Error Handling**: Robust network error detection and recovery

## 🚀 Building & Running

### Prerequisites
- **Compiler**: Requires clang++ (or g++) with C++17 support
- **SFML**: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for graphics and windowing
- **Network Support**: POSIX-compliant system for Berkeley sockets
- **Custom Game Framework**: Built on top of the SFML Game Framework

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kingkururu/quoridor_3D_2P
   cd quoridor_3D_2P
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will compile the Quoridor game along with the networking components.

3. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. **Clean the Build**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

### Alternative Setup (macOS with Homebrew)

1. **Install SFML**:
   ```bash
   # Install Homebrew if not already installed
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   
   # Install SFML
   brew install sfml@2
   brew install .... (other missing libraries)
   ```

2. **Configure PATH** (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile):
   ```bash
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/sfml@2/bin:$PATH"
   export PATH="path to other libraries if any of them is missing)
   ```

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

- **Game Logic Implementation**: Complex rule validation and game state management
- **Network Programming**: Berkeley sockets implementation for real-time multiplayer
- **2.5D Graphics Programming**: Raycasting techniques for 2.5D visualization
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Responsive UI and game state management
